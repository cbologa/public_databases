Treatment of 5-chloro-1-beta-D-ribofuranosylimidazole-4-carboxamide (2) with methanethiol provided 5-(methylthio)-1-beta-D-ribofuranosylimidazole-4-carboxamide (3a). Similar treatment of 2 with ethanethiol or benzenemethanethiol gave the corresponding 5-ethylthio and 5-benzylthio derivatives 3b and 3c. Oxidation of 3a and 3b with m-chloroperoxybenzoic acid furnished the corresponding sulfonyl derivatives 4a and 4b. Reductive cleavage of 3c with sodium naphthalene or Na/NH3 gave 5-mercapto-1-beta-D-ribofuranosylimidazole-4-carboxamide (5-thiobredinin, 5). Direct treatment of 2 with sodium hydrosulfide provided an alternate route to 5, the structure of which was established by single-crystal X-ray analysis. 5-Thiobredinin has a zwitterionic structure similar to that of bredinin. Glycosylation of persilylated ethyl 5(4)-methylimidazole-4(5)-carboxylate (6) with 1-O-acetyl-2,3,5-tri-O-benzoyl-D-ribofuranose in the presence of SnCl4 provided a quantitative yield of the corresponding tri-O-benzoyl nucleoside 7. Debenzoylation of 7 with MeOH/NH3 at ambient temperature gave ethyl 5-methyl-1-beta-D-ribofuranosylimidazole-4-carboxylate (8).

Glycosylation of persilylated ethyl 5(4)-methylimidazole-4(5)-carboxylate (6) with 1-O-acetyl-2,3,5-tri-O-benzoyl-D-ribofuranose in the presence of SnCl4 provided a quantitative yield of the corresponding tri-O-benzoyl nucleoside 7. Debenzoylation of 7 with MeOH/NH3 at ambient temperature gave ethyl 5-methyl-1-beta-D-ribofuranosylimidazole-4-carboxylate (8). Further ammonolysis of 8 or 7 at elevated temperature and pressure gave 5-methyl-1-beta-D-ribofuranosylimidazole-4-carboxamide (9). All of these ribonucleosides were tested in Vero cell cultures and in mice against certain viruses. Compounds 3a and 3c exhibited significant activity against vaccinia virus in vitro, whereas 4a was effective against Rift Valley fever virus in mice. 5-Thiobredinin failed to exhibit appreciable antiviral or cytostatic activity (against L1210 and P388) in cell culture.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               </td><td>NA</td><td>CLD0</td><td>1</td></tr>\n",

The compound has been named tunichlorin and is apparently the first nickel-containing chlorin (and only the second nickel-containing porphyrin-related compound) identified from a living organism.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              </td><td>NA</td><td>CLD0</td><td>1</td></tr>\n",

Narciclasine [1], lycoricidine [2], pancratistatin [4], 7-deoxypancratistatin [5], and acetates 6-8, isonarciclasine [13a], cis-dihydronarciclasine [14a], trans-dihydronarciclasine [15a], their 7-deoxy analogues 13b-15b, lycorines 16 and 17, and pretazettine [18] exhibited consistent in vitro activity against all three flaviviruses and against the bunyaviruses, Punta Toro and Rift Valley fever virus. Activity against sandfly fever virus was only observed with 7-deoxy analogues. In most cases, however, selectivity of the active compounds was low, with toxicity in uninfected cells (TC50) occurring at concentrations within 10-fold that of the viral inhibitory concentrations (IC50). No activity was observed against human immunodeficiency virus-type 1, Venezuelan equine encephalomyelitis virus, or vaccinia viruses. Pancratistatin [4] and its 7-deoxy analogue 5 were evaluated in two murine Japanese encephalitis mouse models (differing in viral dose challenge, among other factors). In two experiments (low LD50 viral challenge, variant I), prophylactic administration of 4 at 4 and 6 mg/kg/day (2% EtOH/saline, sc, once daily for 7 days, day -1 to +5) increased survival of Japanese-encephalitis-virus-infected mice to 100% and 90%, respectively. In the same model, prophylactic administration of 5 at 40 mg/kg/day in hydroxypropylcellulose (sc, once daily for 7 days, day -1 to +5) increased survival of Japanese-encephalitis-virus-infected mice to 80%. In a second variant (high LD50 viral challenge), administration of 4 at 6 mg/kg/day (ip, twice daily for 9 days, day -1 to +7) resulted in a 50% survival rate. In all cases, there was no survival in the diluent-treated control mice. Thus, 4 and 5 demonstrated activity in mice infected with Japanese encephalitis virus but only at near toxic concentrations. To our knowledge, however, this represents a rare demonstration of chemotherapeutic efficacy (by a substance other than an interferon inducer) in a Japanese-encephalitis-virus-infected mouse model.</td><td>NA</td><td>CLD0</td><td>1</td></tr>\n",

The series also included two bis-basic alkanes of N-ethylcarbazole and one bis-basic carboxamide of dibenzofuran.

Narciclasine [1], lycoricidine [2], pancratistatin [4], 7-deoxypancratistatin [5], and acetates 6-8, isonarciclasine [13a], cis-dihydronarciclasine [14a], trans-dihydronarciclasine [15a], their 7-deoxy analogues 13b-15b, lycorines 16 and 17, and pretazettine [18] exhibited consistent in vitro activity against all three flaviviruses and against the bunyaviruses, Punta Toro and Rift Valley fever virus. Activity against sandfly fever virus was only observed with 7-deoxy analogues. In most cases, however, selectivity of the active compounds was low, with toxicity in uninfected cells (TC50) occurring at concentrations within 10-fold that of the viral inhibitory concentrations (IC50). No activity was observed against human immunodeficiency virus-type 1, Venezuelan equine encephalomyelitis virus, or vaccinia viruses. Pancratistatin [4] and its 7-deoxy analogue 5 were evaluated in two murine Japanese encephalitis mouse models (differing in viral dose challenge, among other factors). In two experiments (low LD50 viral challenge, variant I), prophylactic administration of 4 at 4 and 6 mg/kg/day (2% EtOH/saline, sc, once daily for 7 days, day -1 to +5) increased survival of Japanese-encephalitis-virus-infected mice to 100% and 90%, respectively. In the same model, prophylactic administration of 5 at 40 mg/kg/day in hydroxypropylcellulose (sc, once daily for 7 days, day -1 to +5) increased survival of Japanese-encephalitis-virus-infected mice to 80%. In a second variant (high LD50 viral challenge), administration of 4 at 6 mg/kg/day (ip, twice daily for 9 days, day -1 to +7) resulted in a 50% survival rate. In all cases, there was no survival in the diluent-treated control mice. Thus, 4 and 5 demonstrated activity in mice infected with Japanese encephalitis virus but only at near toxic concentrations. To our knowledge, however, this represents a rare demonstration of chemotherapeutic efficacy (by a substance other than an interferon inducer) in a Japanese-encephalitis-virus-infected mouse model. | NA | CLD0 | 1 |\n| 50637 | ORGANISM | Venezuelan equine encephalitis virus | 11036 | Venezuelan equine encephalitis virus | CHEMBL613726 | 0 |  215194 | 13826 | Inhibitory activity of compound against Venezuelan equine encephalomyelitis virus (VEE) was evaluated in vitro; Inactive                                                                           | ⋯ |  8676349 | 10.1021/jm9506783   | CHEMBL1129515 | Synthesis and biological evaluation of1',2'-seconucleo-5'- phosphonates.                                                                                         | PUBLICATION | Racha S, Vargeese C, Vemishetti P, El-Subbagh HI, Abushanab E, Panzica RP.                                                 | A series of 1',2'-seconucleophosphonate analogues were prepared containing adenine, cytosine, thymine, and uracil as the nucleobase.

The series also included two bis-basic alkanes of N-ethylcarbazole and one bis-basic carboxamide of dibenzofuran.

Narciclasine {[}1{]}, lycoricidine {[}2{]}, pancratistatin {[}4{]}, 7-deoxypancratistatin {[}5{]}, and acetates 6-8, isonarciclasine {[}13a{]}, cis-dihydronarciclasine {[}14a{]}, trans-dihydronarciclasine {[}15a{]}, their 7-deoxy analogues 13b-15b, lycorines 16 and 17, and pretazettine {[}18{]} exhibited consistent in vitro activity against all three flaviviruses and against the bunyaviruses, Punta Toro and Rift Valley fever virus. Activity against sandfly fever virus was only observed with 7-deoxy analogues. In most cases, however, selectivity of the active compounds was low, with toxicity in uninfected cells (TC50) occurring at concentrations within 10-fold that of the viral inhibitory concentrations (IC50). No activity was observed against human immunodeficiency virus-type 1, Venezuelan equine encephalomyelitis virus, or vaccinia viruses. Pancratistatin {[}4{]} and its 7-deoxy analogue 5 were evaluated in two murine Japanese encephalitis mouse models (differing in viral dose challenge, among other factors). In two experiments (low LD50 viral challenge, variant I), prophylactic administration of 4 at 4 and 6 mg/kg/day (2\\% EtOH/saline, sc, once daily for 7 days, day -1 to +5) increased survival of Japanese-encephalitis-virus-infected mice to 100\\% and 90\\%, respectively. In the same model, prophylactic administration of 5 at 40 mg/kg/day in hydroxypropylcellulose (sc, once daily for 7 days, day -1 to +5) increased survival of Japanese-encephalitis-virus-infected mice to 80\\%. In a second variant (high LD50 viral challenge), administration of 4 at 6 mg/kg/day (ip, twice daily for 9 days, day -1 to +7) resulted in a 50\\% survival rate. In all cases, there was no survival in the diluent-treated control mice. Thus, 4 and 5 demonstrated activity in mice infected with Japanese encephalitis virus but only at near toxic concentrations. To our knowledge, however, this represents a rare demonstration of chemotherapeutic efficacy (by a substance other than an interferon inducer) in a Japanese-encephalitis-virus-infected mouse model. & NA & CLD0 & 1\\\\\n\t 50637 & ORGANISM & Venezuelan equine encephalitis virus & 11036 & Venezuelan equine encephalitis virus & CHEMBL613726 & 0 &  215194 & 13826 & Inhibitory activity of compound against Venezuelan equine encephalomyelitis virus (VEE) was evaluated in vitro; Inactive                                                                           & ⋯ &  8676349 & 10.1021/jm9506783   & CHEMBL1129515 & Synthesis and biological evaluation of1',2'-seconucleo-5'- phosphonates.                                                                                         & PUBLICATION & Racha S, Vargeese C, Vemishetti P, El-Subbagh HI, Abushanab E, Panzica RP.                                                 & A series of 1',2'-seconucleophosphonate analogues were prepared containing adenine, cytosine, thymine, and uracil as the nucleobase.

              "1   A series of bisalkamine esters, bis-basic ethers, and bis-basic ketones of carbazole, N-ethylcarbazole, dibenzofuran, and dibenzothiophene was synthesized and evaluated for antiviral activity. The series also included two bis-basic alkanes of N-ethylcarbazole and one bis-basic carboxamide of dibenzofuran.

              "7   A number of 5-substituted imidazole-4-carboxamide ribonucleosides were prepared and tested for their biological activity. Treatment of 5-chloro-1-beta-D-ribofuranosylimidazole-4-carboxamide (2) with methanethiol provided 5-(methylthio)-1-beta-D-ribofuranosylimidazole-4-carboxamide (3a).

Reductive cleavage of 3c with sodium naphthalene or Na/NH3 gave 5-mercapto-1-beta-D-ribofuranosylimidazole-4-carboxamide (5-thiobredinin, 5). Direct treatment of 2 with sodium hydrosulfide provided an alternate route to 5, the structure of which was established by single-crystal X-ray analysis. 5-Thiobredinin has a zwitterionic structure similar to that of bredinin. Glycosylation of persilylated ethyl 5(4)-methylimidazole-4(5)-carboxylate (6) with 1-O-acetyl-2,3,5-tri-O-benzoyl-D-ribofuranose in the presence of SnCl4 provided a quantitative yield of the corresponding tri-O-benzoyl nucleoside 7.

The compound has been named tunichlorin and is apparently the first nickel-containing chlorin (and only the second nickel-containing porphyrin-related compound) identified from a living organism.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              \n",
              "13  A series of 23 Amaryllidaceae isoquinoline alkaloids and related synthetic analogues were isolated or synthesized and subsequently evaluated in cell culture against the RNA-containing flaviviruses (Japanese encephalitis, yellow fever, and dengue viruses), bunyaviruses (Punta Toro, sandfly fever, and Rift Valley fever viruses), alphavirus (Venezuelan equine encephalomyelitis virus), lentivirus (human immunodeficiency virus-type 1) and the DNA-containing vaccinia virus. Narciclasine [1], lycoricidine [2], pancratistatin [4], 7-deoxypancratistatin [5], and acetates 6-8, isonarciclasine [13a], cis-dihydronarciclasine [14a], trans-dihydronarciclasine [15a], their 7-deoxy analogues 13b-15b, lycorines 16 and 17, and pretazettine [18] exhibited consistent in vitro activity against all three flaviviruses and against the bunyaviruses, Punta Toro and Rift Valley fever virus. Activity against sandfly fever virus was only observed with 7-deoxy analogues. In most cases, however, selectivity of the active compounds was low, with toxicity in uninfected cells (TC50) occurring at concentrations within 10-fold that of the viral inhibitory concentrations (IC50). No activity was observed against human immunodeficiency virus-type 1, Venezuelan equine encephalomyelitis virus, or vaccinia viruses. Pancratistatin [4] and its 7-deoxy analogue 5 were evaluated in two murine Japanese encephalitis mouse models (differing in viral dose challenge, among other factors). In two experiments (low LD50 viral challenge, variant I), prophylactic administration of 4 at 4 and 6 mg/kg/day (2% EtOH/saline, sc, once daily for 7 days, day -1 to +5) increased survival of Japanese-encephalitis-virus-infected mice to 100% and 90%, respectively. In the same model, prophylactic administration of 5 at 40 mg/kg/day in hydroxypropylcellulose (sc, once daily for 7 days, day -1 to +5) increased survival of Japanese-encephalitis-virus-infected mice to 80%. In a second variant (high LD50 viral challenge), administration of 4 at 6 mg/kg/day (ip, twice daily for 9 days, day -1 to +7) resulted in a 50% survival rate. In all cases, there was no survival in the diluent-treated control mice. Thus, 4 and 5 demonstrated activity in mice infected with Japanese encephalitis virus but only at near toxic concentrations. To our knowledge, however, this represents a rare demonstration of chemotherapeutic efficacy (by a substance other than an interferon inducer) in a Japanese-encephalitis-virus-infected mouse model.\n",

Their synthesis was accomplished from d-ribose by developing a more facile precursor route than suggested by the literature. The 2/4d-like pair displayed significant anti-filo virial properties while the enantiomeric l-like congeners 3/5 were inactive. Target compounds 2/4 also were active towards measles and norovirus. The effect of 2/4 is further evidence of the role fluoro-derived adenine carbocyclic nucleoside can play in antiviral drug discovery. Furthermore, the simplicity of their synthesis lends them to more efficacious analogs and to scale-up optimization.

There were no other relevant antiviral properties for 2/3 and 4/5 (except BK polyomavirus for 3/5).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    \n",
